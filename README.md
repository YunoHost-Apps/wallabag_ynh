Wallabag v1 for Yunohost
------------------------

**Shipped version:** 1.9.2

[Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/) is a self hostable application allowing
you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can. It
extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.

## Limitation

This application does not connect to the LDAP, which is needed to retrieve
users information - such as the password. One consequence is that you will
not be able to use third-party applications which are not Web browser add-on -
i.e. the Android application. Conversely, the add-ons for Firefox and Chrome
will work as long as you're connected to the SSO.

## Future...

As the upgrade to Wallabag 2 need a manual intervention - see the
[migration guide](http://doc.wallabag.org/en/master/user/migration.html),
a new separate package will be made for this version. If you want to do it or
help, you're welcome!
