Wallabag v1 for Yunohost
------------------------

*This is a work-in-progress package review to update it with changes
new facilities - e.g. helpers - coming with YunoHost 2.4*

**Shipped version:** 1.9.2

[Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.org/) is a self hostable application allowing
you to not miss any content anymore. Click, save, read it when you can. It
extracts content so that you can read it when you have time.

## Installation

While it's merged to the official application list, you can install it in order
to try - or use it with caution! - either from the command line:

    $ sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag_ynh/tree/testing

or from the Web administration:

  * Go to *Applications*
  * Click on *Install*
  * Scroll to the bottom of the page and put `https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/wallabag_ynh/tree/testing`
    under **Install custom app**.

## TODO ##

 * Add `backup` and `restore` scripts
